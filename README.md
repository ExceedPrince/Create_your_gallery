# Create_your_gallery

This was a solo project in CodeCool's Frontend Developer course.

Do you know The Million Dollar Homepage? If not, here's the link: http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/

In this project I had to make a very similar application to it, where the user can upload his/her images, and they will appear next to each oder as a mosaic gallery.
There had to be 2 upload options: by clicking and by drag & drop technique. I added an own feature: if the user clicks on the uploaded image, it will appear in a popup modal.
You can download as much picture az you want, but his application has no any database, so they will disappear if you refresh the page.

This project was made with pure HTML, CSS and Javascript.
